This is our website which will provide an interface for both local street vendors and their suppliers to buy or sell items at competitive prize. Our idea is inspired from auctions happening in local markets(mandi) where auctions are held every morning to buy or sell goods. Our website follows the same pattern where both vendors and suppliers can organize or join an auction. The difference is vendors will bid for the highest amount ( traditional mandi style) and suppliers will bid for lowest amount.
Additionally, vendors can also submit their requirements, which will be displayed to the suppliers directly and they can respond to the demand without any auction. 

For the process of auction for vendor, he/she will mention the name of the item he/she wants, quantity and amount and can list the auction after giving start and end time( however can start the auction before time).

for supplier auction process, he/she first list the stock which will contain the same details like name, quantity, prize and can start the auction.
